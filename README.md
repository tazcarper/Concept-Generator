Brainstorming App built on Angular and Node.js. -- WORK IN PROGRESS --

## Description

This app was a prototype for an activity generator. Let's say your team wants to concept a new idea, but needs something to stimulate the concepting process. You could use this app to find activites based on the number of people you have and the time you have. Never finished it. Some good practice with Angular 1 tho.

# Building a Plan
User would select plans from different phases. Essentially to build a plan. Each activity would be added to an object and then a report would be calculated at the end where the user could see them all together, all their time, ect...

# Explore
A way to look through everything and filter. Not a linear plan builder. Just a catalog type thing.

## Build

Run `grunt build` for building and 

## Serve

Run `grunt serve` for preview / live watch.
